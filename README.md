# LibrarySystemProject
This is project for Java learning purposes. Library system with MS Server SQL data base

This hypothetical system is designed for common user and library workers. There are available options such as book or movie searching tool, borrowing and returning library elements, etc. In case of library worker there are advanced tools like user's and library elements management system, borrowing and returning managment, etc.

I had prepared MS Server SQL DataBase before for similar project in C# so i will use it also in this case.
